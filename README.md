# Python-Project---NBA-Dataset

This project involved analyzing a dataset by performing preprocessing tasks like height correction and validating key columns, followed by exploratory data analysis and visualizations. Key insights included disparities in team sizes, the dominance of midfielders and defenders, a concentration of players aged 20-30, and the high salaries commanded by forwards. A weak positive correlation between age and salary was also observed. Bar charts, pie charts, histograms, and scatter plots were used for visualization, offering valuable guidance for team management, player evaluation, and strategic decisions.
